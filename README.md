# README

In this file, we provide some guide about purpose of each code script


# Continuous Response Simulation

The main code script is `CZ_github_numerical_simulation.m` and supplementary TRI plots are stored at the folder "Continuous Simu TRI"

# Poisson Response Simulation

The main code script is `CZ_Poisson_simulation2.m` which can be found in the subfolder "Poisson Reg Simulation"

# Beijing Housing Price

The dataset source is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruiqurm/lianjia 

However, we made some changes mainly about adding interaction of variables. Because github has limit of file size, so we upload dataset files to a public Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZNNO3xX0UCqFxVRUHlJcKIuxhDbW-bIn?usp=sharing

For the table displayinh the "Summary of estimation results for Beijing housing price using different methods", it was generated in the script `CZ_github_BJ.m`. For the plot of estimated zero regions and the summary of "Summary of three important covariates of district-specific linear regression results of Beijing
housing price data", it was generated in the script `CZ_github_BJ_plots.m`
